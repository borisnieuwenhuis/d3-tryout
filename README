You can just open the files in a local browser, is tested in Safari.
football.html is an animation of the result of a football match, point x,y corresponds to a result, like 1-1 draw 
,the size of the circle is determined by the number of voters. Data is random results with 0<=x<10 and 0<=y<10

football2.html is the same, but then with the real results of a prediction, i think feyenoord-excelsior. Not animated all results are plotted at once.
